I am a Robotics Engineer with a significant experience on Mobile Robots, Quadcopters and Manipulators. I graduated with Masters degree in Robotics from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/), where I researched the intricacies of controls,planning,perception and learning. Additionally, I hold a B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering, Design, and Manufacturing from [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing](https://iiitdm.ac.in), where I gained a solid foundation in the field of engineering.

I am currently working as an Advanced Robotics Software Engineer at [Honeywell](https://Honeywell.com). I recently interned in the role of Robotics Engineer at [Vantage Robotics](https://vantagerobotics.com/), where I was tasked with the implementation of autonomous flying capabilities for their cutting-edge drone technology. Furthermore, I have four years of hands-on experience in the realm of warehouse automation and IIoT, acquired during my tenure at [Saint-Gobain India](https://www.saint-gobain.co.in/), where I designed and developed a plethora of smart manufacturing systems including, but not limited to Digital Twin, Forklift Localization, Predictive Maintenance utilizing AI, OEE, Warehouse Management and a Data Analytics Platform for Industrial Energy Management, all of which were imbued with [Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution) technologies.

Throughout my career, I have played various roles such as an engineer, manager, and an instructor, providing me with a well-rounded perspective on the industry.
