As the former Head of the Robotics Club at my undergraduate alma mater, I possessed a strong leadership role in which I successfully managed and coordinated the club's activities for two semesters. On a bi-monthly basis, I conducted informative knowledge transfer sessions on the topics of robotics, embedded devices, sensors, and robot autonomy to my peers. Additionally, I played a vital role in organizing and executing inter-intra college technical fests that attracted a significant number of participants, showcasing my ability to effectively plan and execute events on a large scale.
