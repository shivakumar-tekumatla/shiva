I was the head of robotics club for two semesters at my undergrad alma-mater. Twice a month , I conducted knowledge transfer sessions to my peers about robotics, embedded devices, sensors and robot autonomy. As part of this role, I also organized inter-intra college technical fests that attracted hundreds of participants.
