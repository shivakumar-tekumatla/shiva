Fault type and depth for bearings in rotary machines  were  estimated  from  vibration  data  using  linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, and neural network approaches. Each method was used to classify inner race, outer race and rolling element bearing faults. The accuracy of each method for differentiating between bearing fault types and  estimating  fault  depths  using  vibration  data  envelope spectrum analysis is compared. A novel combination of envelope spectrum  preprocessing  with  neural  networks  achieved prediction accuracy exceeding 99% for fault type classification, and  95%  for  fault  depth  estimation.  Classification  accuracy exceeding 95% was also realized using random forest methods. The results indicate that performance could be further improved with a larger neural network and additional training data.
