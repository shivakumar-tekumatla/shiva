In this project, implementation of a remote motion controller with visual feedback on an android device with Wi-Fi communication protocol is proposed. Control algorithm incorporates the real-time data available from the camera, which is used as feedback, which in turn, greatly improves efficiency. This application can be implemented on any Android device (e.g. smart phone) with a built-in camera, making it extremely compact, economical and user-friendly when compared to existing similar controllers. It also gives the flexibility to control the mobile robot via the internet.
