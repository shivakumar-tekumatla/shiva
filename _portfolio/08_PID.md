This program plots the Time Series Response of Closed Loop Control System with P, I , PI , PD and PID controls with Unit Step Input
Give Actuator+Plant input to this program in the val_update() function.
The Values of Proportional, Integral and Differential Gains can be changed using the Sliders.
If the input is a 1st order system , then the Time constant can also be changed using a Slider.
