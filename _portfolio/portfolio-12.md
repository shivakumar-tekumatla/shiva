This document consist of project implementation of a filter-based stereo visual inertial odometry that uses the Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF). The mathematical concepts of a stereo-MSCKF are implemented within a frameworkof given starter-code. The results and observations for each step has been recorded in this document.
