This paper discusses on an open source python based three-axis CNC system. Python being one of the easiest languages to understand exempts the user from requiring extreme programming skills to amend the code for personal use. This paper features a novel way of directly importing the CAD file into the system without the use of any G-code parser. This system is economical as it utilizes Arduino UNO board as a signal
generator without compromising on the performance of the system.
